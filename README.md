The LM35 is a temperature sensor that provides an analog output voltage proportional to the temperature in degrees Celsius. This sensor can be easily interfaced with the PIC18F4580 to measure temperature. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to read the temperature from an LM35 using the ADC module of the PIC18F4580:

1. Hardware Connections
Connect the LM35 to the PIC18F4580:
Vcc: Connect to the 5V power supply.
GND: Connect to the ground.
Vout: Connect to the ADC input pin (e.g., AN0) of the PIC18F4580.
Explanation of the Conversion
ADC Value to Voltage:

The ADC converts the analog input (0-5V) to a digital value (0-1023 for a 10-bit ADC).
The voltage corresponding to the ADC value is calculated as:

Voltage to Temperature:

The LM35 outputs 10mV per degree Celsius.
Thus, the temperature in Celsius is given by:

initialization:

ADC_Init: Sets up the ADC module.
LCD_Init: Sets up the LCD in 4-bit mode.
Reading and Conversion:

ADC_Read: Reads the ADC value from the specified channel.
ConvertToTemperature: Converts the ADC value to a temperature in Celsius.
LCD Operations:

LCD_Command: Sends a command to the LCD.
LCD_Char: Sends a character to the LCD.
LCD_String: Sends a string to the LCD.
LCD_SetCursor: Sets the cursor to a specified position on the LCD.
LCD_Clear: Clears the LCD display.
